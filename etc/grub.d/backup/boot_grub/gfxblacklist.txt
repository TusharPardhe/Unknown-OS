# GRUB gfxpayload blacklist.  The format is a sequence of lines of the
# following form, using lower-case hexadecimal for all ID components:
#
#   vVENDORdDEVICEsvSUBVENDORsdSUBDEVICEbcBASECLASSscSUBCLASS
#
# Blacklist lines are regex-matched (currently using Lua's string.find with
# the line surrounded by ^ and $) against a corresponding PCI ID string.  In
# practice this means that you can replace any part of the ID string with .*
# to match anything.
#
# There is no need to customise this file locally.  If you need to disable
# gfxpayload=keep on your system, just add this line (uncommented) to
# /etc/default/grub:
#
#   GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=text

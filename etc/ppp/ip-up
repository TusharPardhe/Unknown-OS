# This script is run by the pppd after the link is established.
# It uses run-parts to run scripts in /etc/ppp/ip-up.d, so to add routes,
# set IP address, run the mailq etc. you should create script(s) there.
#
# Be aware that other packages may include /etc/ppp/ip-up.d scripts (named
# after that package), so choose local script names with that in mind.
#
# This script is called with the following arguments:
#    Arg  Name                          Example
#    $1   Interface name                ppp0
#    $2   The tty                       ttyS1
#    $3   The link speed                38400
#    $4   Local IP number               12.34.56.78
#    $5   Peer  IP number               12.34.56.99
#    $6   Optional ``ipparam'' value    foo

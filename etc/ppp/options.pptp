# Sample PPTP PPP options file /etc/ppp/options.pptp
# Options used by PPP when a connection is made by a PPTP client.
# This file can be referred to by an /etc/ppp/peers file for the tunnel.
# Changes are effective on the next connection.  See "man pppd".
#
# You are expected to change this file to suit your system.  As
# packaged, it requires PPP 2.4.2 or later from http://ppp.samba.org/
# and the kernel MPPE module available from the CVS repository also on
# http://ppp.samba.org/, which is packaged for DKMS as kernel_ppp_mppe.

# Authentication
# We don't need the tunnel server to authenticate itself
noauth

# We won't do PAP, EAP, CHAP, or MSCHAP, but we will accept MSCHAP-V2
# (you may need to remove these refusals if the server is not using MPPE)
refuse-pap
refuse-eap
refuse-chap
refuse-mschap

# Compression
# Turn off compression protocols we know won't be used
nobsdcomp
nodeflate

# Encryption
# (There have been multiple versions of PPP with encryption support,
# choose which of the following sections you will use.  Note that MPPE
# requires the use of MSCHAP-V2 during authentication)
#
# Note that using PPTP with MPPE and MSCHAP-V2 should be considered
# insecure:

This directory contains settings similar to those found in /etc/sysctl.conf.
In general, files in the 10-*.conf range come from the procps package and
serve as system defaults.  Other packages install their files in the
30-*.conf range, to override system defaults.  End-users can use 60-*.conf
and above, or use /etc/sysctl.conf directly, which overrides anything in
this directory.

After making any changes, please run "service procps start" (or, from
a Debian package maintainer script "invoke-rc.d procps start").

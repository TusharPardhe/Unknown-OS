In this directory, the system administrator can install menufiles to
override the menu files provided by Debian in /usr/lib/menu, /usr/share/menu
and /usr/share/menu/default.

The filename should be the name of the package that it is overriding,
and may contain as many lines and menu entries as necessary.

Please run 'update-menus' after changing or adding files.

For more info, please read /usr/share/doc/menu/html.

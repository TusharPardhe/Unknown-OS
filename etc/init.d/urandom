## Assumption 1:  We assume $SAVEDFILE is a file (or a symlink
## to a file) that resides on a non-volatile medium that persists
## across reboots.
## Case 1a: Ideally, it is readable and writeable.  Its is unshared,
## i.e. its contents are unique to this machine.  It is protected so
## that its contents are not known to attackers.
## Case 1b: Less than ideally, it is read-only.  Its contents are
## unique to this machine and not known to attackers.

# Note: this is a sample and will not be run as is.  Change the name of this
# file to <gdmconfdir>/PostLogin/Default for this script to be run.  This
# script will be run before any setup is run on behalf of the user and is
# useful if you for example need to do some setup to create a home directory
# for the user or something like that.  $HOME, $LOGIN and such will all be
# set appropriately and this script is run as root.

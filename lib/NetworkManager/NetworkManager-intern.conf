# Internal configuration file. This file is written and read
# by NetworkManager and its configuration values are merged
# with the configuration from 'NetworkManager.conf'.
#
# Keys with a ".set." prefix specify the value to set.
# A corresponding key with a ".was." prefix records the value
# of the user configuration at the time of storing the file.
# The value from internal configuration is rejected if the corresponding
# ".was." key no longer matches the configuration from 'NetworkManager.conf'.
# That means, if you modify a value in 'NetworkManager.conf', the internal
# overwrite no longer matches and is ignored.
#
# Certain sections can only be overwritten whole, not on a per key basis.
# Such sections are marked with a ".was" key that records the user configuration
# at the time of writing.
#
# Internal sections of the form [.intern.*] cannot
# be set by user configuration.
#
# CHANGES TO THIS FILE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
